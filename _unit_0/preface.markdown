I wanted to make tshirts. That lead me to study Graphic Design and ultimately become a Web Developer. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. You may not either. And that is OK. Together we will explore the social implications and responsibilities of your craft. We'll analyze the web from an architect's perspective and discover design patterns that ensure the creations we present to society are universal, inclusive, accessible, efficient and performant. 

There is a responsibility that comes with authoring the web; remember what it is short for: the world wide web. So as you publish to the web ask yourself “Is this world wide?”. Can anyone find it? Once found can anyone access it? Once accessed can anyone use it?

As a social architect it is your responsibility to integrate inclusive design patterns into your work. Not because it is the right thing to do. This book isn't about morality. It is your responsibility because inclusive design patterns foster a better experience for everyone and it is your responsibility to design to the best of your ability. 

Architects bare the responsibility of designing for the public using inclusive design patterns and practices. For if they do not, society as a whole suffers. This book provides you with tooling to author the web with social considerations in mind.
