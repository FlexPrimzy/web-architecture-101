Similar to an architect designing a public building in the physical world, as a Web Architect it will be your responsibility to inclusively provide for, shelter, and protect users of the world wide&nbsp;web. 

A web page whose primary content is only accessible by enabled modern browsers is not a world wide web page. Web pages that are not navigable by keyboard or screen reader are like inaccessible buildings in the physical world &mdash; not accessible to all members of&nbsp;society.

Architects bare the responsibility of designing for the public using inclusive design patterns and practices. For if they do not, the society as a whole suffers. This course provides you with the knowledge to author the web with social considerations in mind.
