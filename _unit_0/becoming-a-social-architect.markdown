Similar to an architect designing a public building in the physical world, as a Web Architect it will be your responsibility to inclusively provide for, shelter, and protect users of the world wide&nbsp;web. 

A web page whose primary content is only accessible by enabled modern browsers is not a world wide web page. Web pages that are not navigable by keyboard or screen reader are like inaccessible buildings in the physical world &mdash; not accessible to all members of&nbsp;society.

Architects bare the responsibility of designing for the public using inclusive design patterns and practices. For if they do not, the society as a whole suffers. This course provides you with the knowledge to author the web with social considerations in mind.

If a Web Developer is a contractor who can build structures on the Web, a Web Architect is a Web Developer who assumes the responsibilities of constructing according to public needs. Both of these people build, but the Architect builds with the knowledge that what she makes is meant to be used by a wide variety of people. She does not balance branding guidelines and style guides with the needs of the commonwealth &mdash; she marries them. Together as one, the style guide and branding influence and improve accessibility considerations. Likewise, accessibility considerations influence and improve the brand. 

> The accessibility of your application should represent the accessibility of your&nbsp;brand. But what is the accessibility of your&nbsp;brand?

Understanding that a more accessible design is better for anyone and everyone, Web Architects incorporate accessible design patterns into their process. While doing so ensures all people can use them, it also ensures a better experience for anyone who does use it. Utilizing these patterns is a win&ndash;win. And it doesn't have to cost us a bunch of time and money. 

To sharpen brand messaging, designers focus their message on target audiences. Hypothetical characters are created. The brand messaging then aims to communication with that particular audience. But what if the "target audience" is not disabled. Should we still bother with accessibility?

#### TL;DR
 - Yes, accessibility makes things better for&nbsp;everyone
 - Ask yourself if and when your target audience may become disabled 
 
Even if your target audience is Bob &mdash; an exceptionally able&ndash;bodied skate boarder in his early 20s, there may come a time and a place when Bob is in need of accessibility considerations. This need may arise based on context, injury, or time. When skateboarding down a steep hill Bob needs to keep both eyes on the road. So he uses voice commands to operate his smart phone. These features were not just designed for the physically blind but the contextually blind as well. Bob's sight is focused on the road making him contextually blind. Throughout his skateboarding career, Bob may suffer injury. After breaking his dominant hand, Bob enjoys accessibility preferences that cater to users with low mobility. Abilities are lessened and lost with age. This happens to any of us &ndash; to any target audience. If all goes well your target audience may experience any of these contextual, temporary, or indefinite losses of ability. Will your brand still be there when they do?
