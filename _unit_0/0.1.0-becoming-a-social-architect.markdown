Similar to an architect designing a public building in the physical world, as a Web Architect it will be your responsibility to inclusively provide for, shelter, and protect all users of the world wide&nbsp;web. 

A web page, site, or app whose content is only accessible by abled users with modern browsers is not a world wide web experience; it is not inclusive. Web experiences that do not support assistive technology are like inaccessible buildings in the physical world. Without access to all members of society, these creations harm not only disabled individuals but all of society. For by excluding any members of society we lose their company, perspective, and business.

You have no intention of harming society. But you may be wondering, what will accessibility cost me? The best practices and design patterns involved in creating accessible user experiences do not apply solely to accessibility and therefore should not be measured or budgeted as such. Progressive Enhancement is the foundation of an accessible experience. Without progressive enhancement as a base you can not achieve a universally inclusive experience. The good news is progressive enhancement will not only improve accessibility but speed, performance, search engine optimization as well. That's not all. Progressive Enhancement will also help keep our codebase more maintainable and even improve, rather than decay, over time.

Cross walks should be accessible to everyone. When we design our crosswalk we realize that not all users are sighted. They may not be able to see the sign which indicates when it is safe to cross the street. So we also need a non&ndash;visual solution. Before paving the crosswalk and opening the intersection to the public, we wire it for [audible beaconing](http://www.apsguide.org/chapter4_beaconing.cfm) making the experience more inclusive. The construction workers pave the cross walk. Sighted and non&ndash;sighted people use it. The End. This story has a pleasant ending because we embraced inclusive design patterns throughout our process. Imagine if we hadn't. Imagine if we paved the road before we wired the cross walk for audible beaconing&hellip; After receiving complaints and perhaps even law suits, and with the cross walk already paved, we'd be looking at an expensive job to upgrade the cross walk. We'd have to close the intersection, jack up the road, wire it for audible beaconing, and then pave it again. This cost is much more expensive than a little inclusive design and the foresight to inclusively wire the cross walk before paving it and before the road was open to the public. Is accessibility to blame for this preventable closure and expense? Or is lack of inclusive design, specifically before the road was paved, to blame?

If a Web Developer is a contractor who can build structures on the Web, a Web Architect is a Web Developer who assumes the responsibilities of constructing according to public needs. Both of these people build, but the Architect builds with the knowledge that what she makes is meant to be used by a wide variety of people. She does not balance branding guidelines and style guides with the needs of the commonwealth &mdash; she marries them. Together, the style guide and branding influence and improve accessibility considerations. Likewise, accessibility considerations influence and improve the brand. 

> The accessibility of your application should represent the accessibility of your&nbsp;brand. So, what is the accessibility of your&nbsp;brand?

Understanding that a more accessible design is better for anyone and everyone, Web Architects incorporate accessible design patterns into their process. While doing so ensures all people can use them, it also ensures a better experience for anyone who does use it. Utilizing these patterns is a win&ndash;win. And it doesn't have to cost us a bunch of time and money. 

To sharpen brand messaging, designers focus their message on target audiences. Hypothetical characters are created. The brand messaging then aims to communication with that particular audience. But what if the "target audience" is not disabled. Should we still bother with accessibility?

#### TL;DR
 - Accessibility makes things better for&nbsp;everyone
 - Ask yourself if and when your target audience may become disabled 
 
Even if your target audience is Bob &mdash; an exceptionally able&ndash;bodied skate boarder in his early 20s, there may come a time and a place when Bob is in need of accessibility considerations. This need may arise based on context, injury, or time. When skateboarding down a steep hill Bob needs to keep both eyes on the road. So he uses voice commands to operate his smart phone. These features were not just designed for the physically blind but the contextually blind as well. Bob's sight is focused on the road making him contextually blind. Throughout his skateboarding career, Bob may suffer injury. After breaking his dominant hand, Bob enjoys accessibility preferences that cater to users with low mobility. Abilities are lessened and lost with age. This happens to any of us &ndash; to any target audience. If all goes well your target audience may experience any of these contextual, temporary, or indefinite losses of ability. Will your brand still be there when they do?
