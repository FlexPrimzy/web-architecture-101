An Introduction to Web Architecture is brought to you as an opensource publication by Markup.Tips. You can access the digital content as a web site, progressive web app, or even an eBook. The eBook will be sold through Gumroad for a flexible suggested price of $9.99. We are using a name&ndash;your&ndash;own&ndash;price model so as to allow you to purchase the eBook for whatever you think it is worth, or whatever you can afford, even if that is $0. In doing so we are pleased to know this keeps the book itself accessible to&nbsp;everyone.

We'd love to know what you think.
